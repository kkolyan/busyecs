# About
Busy ECS - extremely nice (and most likely slow) ECS framework. Intended to use [LeoECS Lite](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecslite) under the hood as the component storage engine.

# Goals
Nice looking code at any price.

# How to use
Look to [Example.cs](test/Example.cs) for brief, but complete step-by overview.

# Plans
If it shows really good coding experience and really bad performance, I'll think how to optimize it using AST transformations at build time.
